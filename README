Syscall and helper library for the Casio FX-CG (Prizm) color graphing calculator

Not much to see here except the syscalls, hopefully that will change in the future.

IMPORTANT NOTICE!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you compiled your own gcc, you may have compiled libgcc as well.  If so, it
is IMPORTANT to replace your libgcc with the one supplied in lib/.

libc
stdout prints to the LCD, no scrolling.
stdin isn't functional.
stderr prints to serial, just like it was before.
